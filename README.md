# Circular Journeys Frontend

## :star2: About the Project

The Travel-themed website is built using technologies including the React library for the frontend, Node.js for the server-side, and MySql database to handle data storage and retrieval.

The website has been designed into four main features include: Member Center, Travel Blog, E-commerce Platform, and a customizable touring feature.

I was responsible for designing and structuring the website's online store, as well as implementing the shopping process. I integrated the Stripe API to handle credit card authentication and payments, ensuring that customer information remains secure.

Implementations include:
- Search, filter and sort the products and display them with infinite scrolling 
- Designed the shopping cart modal and use useContext to synchronize data throuout the site
- Employed SCSS for the styling and utilized Material UI to create a slider that filters product prices
- Add, modify, and delete user addresses and update the database asynchrounously using fetch
- CORS and Express to handle HTTP requests and responses and to prevent cross-platform resource sharing errors

Technologies used: React, JavaScript, CSS3/SCSS, Node.js, MySQL, and the Stripe API

## Membership System
### ✏️ By Alan Chou

The membership system plays a critical role in our website, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and access exclusive content. As the developer in charge of this system, I worked closely with other team members to seamlessly integrate it into the site, prioritizing security and user-friendliness.

Users have the option to register and log in to their accounts using either their email or Google accounts. To ensure security and prevent unauthorized access, I implemented email verification through emailjs, which also includes the option to reset forgotten passwords.

For added functionality, I also incorporated Firebase storage to allow users to upload and change their profile pictures. Additionally, to establish seamless communication between the server and backend data, I utilized HTTP CORS and Axios to send and receive API requests.

## Blog Section 
### ✏️  By Joana
In this project, I responsibled for both the front-end and back-end development of the blog page. 

Regarding the front-end, I designed and implemented the CKEditor as the article editor, which enables users to create and edit articles. I also added the functionality for users to add hashtags to their articles, increasing their richness and exposure. Additionally, I implemented the like feature that enables users to show their appreciation for articles. Moreover, I integrated the official weather API open data to provide weather forecasts for different regions of Kaohsiung, enhancing the user experience.

On the back-end, I worked on the database design and implementation, as well as developed APIs to handle front-end requests and stored data in a mySQL database. I also implemented parameter validation to verify if the id in the parameter exists in the database. If it does not exist, the user is redirected to a not-found page.

Overall, my contributions to this project included a range of front-end and back-end tasks, which enabled the creation of a user-friendly and functional blog page.
