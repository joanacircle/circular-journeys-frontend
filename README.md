# Circular Journeys Frontend

## :star2: About the Project

The Travel-themed website is built using technologies including the React library for the frontend, Node.js for the server-side, and MySql database to handle data storage and retrieval.

The website has been designed into four main features include: Member Center, Travel Blog, E-commerce Platform, and a customizable touring feature.

## E-commerce Section 
### ✏️  By Kevin La

I played a key role in building out the ecommerce page and implementing a secure payment system for our users. One of the key features I worked on was integrating the Stripe API to provide a seamless payment experience that ensures customer data is kept secure.

To help with styling, I utilized Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor that allows for cleaner and more efficient code. I also applied Material UI to create an intuitive slider bar for filtering product prices, which helped to improve the user experience.

For added visual effects, I incorporated Animate.css, a library that provides pre-built CSS animations that can be easily added to elements on the page. It was used for the shopping cart.

I implemented react-loading-skeleton, a library that provides customizable placeholders for images while they're being loaded in the background.

Finally, I used CORS and Express to handle HTTP requests and responses, and to prevent cross-platform resource sharing errors.

## Membership System
### ✏️ By Alan Chou

The membership system plays a critical role in our website, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and access exclusive content. As the developer in charge of this system, I worked closely with other team members to seamlessly integrate it into the site, prioritizing security and user-friendliness.

Users have the option to register and log in to their accounts using either their email or Google accounts. To ensure security and prevent unauthorized access, I implemented email verification through emailjs, which also includes the option to reset forgotten passwords.

For added functionality, I also incorporated Firebase storage to allow users to upload and change their profile pictures. Additionally, to establish seamless communication between the server and backend data, I utilized HTTP CORS and Axios to send and receive API requests.
